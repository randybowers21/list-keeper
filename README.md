## What I've Learned
I figured Id try to stray from the conventional Todo lists of React and try my own thing. And it works but still needs some refining.

I tried my own styling again and I'm learning as I go but I still have some major work to do.

My first try at JSON Server and it was really easy to use and intuitive. I like it for small projects like this.
